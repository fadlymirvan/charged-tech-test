```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
    def update
        article = Article.find(params[:id])
        
        article.update(form_params)

        if article.genre == 'Pop'
            article.publish_date = Date.today + 1.month
            article.status = 'pending_review'
        elsif article.genre == 'Animals'
            article.publish_date = Date.today + 2.weeks
            article.status = 'pending_approval'
        end
        
        article.save!

        if article.status == 'pending_review'
            writer = article.writer
            if writer.articles.count > 10
                writer.status = 'pending_upgrade_review'
                writer.save!
                SendWriterUpgradeMail.perform_now(writer)
            end
        end
    end
end
```

Yes, there will be changes from that controller. First is to create a private method that will be set the value of `form_params`. In this case I use permit

```Ruby
def form_params
    params.require(:article)
          .permit(:title, :status, :genre)
end
```

After that, I will move the logic to set `publish_date` and `status` into one method to make the code maintainable and readable

```Ruby
def status_and_publish_date(article)
    case article.genre
    when 'Pop'
        article.publish_date = Date.today + 1.month
        article.status = 'pending_review'
    when 'Animals'
        article.publish_date = Date.today + 2.weeks
        article.status = 'pending_approval'
    end
end
```

We also can move the logic to update writer into method and change the logic to run `SendWriterUpgradeMail` from `perform_now` into background task using `perform_later`
```Ruby
def update_writer_status(writer)
    writer.status = 'pending_upgrade_review'
    writer.save!
    SendWriterUpgradeMail.perform_later(writer)
end
```

The final controller will look like this

```Ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
    def update
        article = Article.find(params[:id])
        article.update(form_params)
        status_and_publish_date(article)
        article.save!

        if article.status == 'pending_review'
            writer = article.writer
            update_writer_status(writer) if writer.articles.count > 10
        end
    end

    private

    def form_params
        params.require(:article).permit(:id, :title, :status, :genre)
    end

    def status_and_publish_date(article)
        case article.genre
        when 'Pop'
            article.publish_date = Date.today + 1.month
            article.status = 'pending_review'
        when 'Animals'
            article.publish_date = Date.today + 2.weeks
            article.status = 'pending_approval'
        end
    end    
    
    def update_writer_status(writer)
        writer.status = 'pending_upgrade_review'
        writer.save!
        SendWriterUpgradeMail.perform_later(writer)
    end
end
```

Overall, these changes aim to improve code organization, maintainability, and readability by extracting logic into separate methods and adhering to Rails conventions, such as using strong parameters for attribute whitelisting and utilizing background tasks for email delivery.
